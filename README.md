Based on the videos, we have decided in favor of Kinect2 since the point cloud it gives is much more clear and viewing angles are also better than RealSense R200. RealSense pointcloud has less points. Also, the minimum range of Kinect2 is much less. When Ensenso arrives, the tables will be updated accordingly.
